# IOT-Based-Prepaid-Electricity-Billing-System
The major drawback of traditional billing system is power and energy theft. This drawback is reduced by using a prepaid energy meter which is based on the concept
Pay first and then use it.We here propose a prepaid energy billing meter. The system is designed to allow amount of energy to be used as long as the account has balance pending. It also allows the operator to recharge the user account. The system first accepts account recharge and allows to use only limited units of energy as per recharge and then cuts off the supply. The prepaid electricity billing meter could be widely used to provide a new more customized electricity billing system, where users may recharge when they intend to use that facility.
